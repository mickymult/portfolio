This repository contains the implementation of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model, using the newly released Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 as the Language Model, SentenceTransformers for embedding, and llama-index for data ingestion, vectorization, and storage. The model has been implemented in a Google Colab notebook, optimized for a v100 instance.
